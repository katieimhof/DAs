    "## Project Part 1 (15 pts)\n",
    "We are starting the data science project in this class early! The project is called \"Quantified Self\" and for this project you are going to create and analyze your own dataset by collecting longitudinal data (data collected over time) on yourself. This first part of the project is to get your creative juices flowing regarding what data on yourself you want to collect (and later analyze). There are two different types of data sources that can be used to collect data on yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Data Sources\n",
    "These data sources are software/hardware systems that automatically collect the data and provide an interface for accessing/downloading the data. For example, can you export data from an app you regularly use related to fitness, sleep, screen usage, web browsing history, games, budgeting/banking, etc. Examples from past projects include:\n",
    "* [Fitbit (or similar, like Apple Health or Strava)](https://www.fitbit.com/settings/data/export): download automatically tracked exercise/health data from the app and your wearable:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC222/DAs/raw/master/figures/fitbit_data_download.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Spotify (or similar, like Apple Music)](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/): download music streaming data\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC222/DAs/raw/master/figures/spotify_data_download.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/): download data from various Google services, like Timeline/location history and YouTube viewing history\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC222/DAs/raw/master/figures/google_data_download.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me): download usage data, like message content and activity\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC222/DAs/raw/master/figures/discord_data_download.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC222/DAs/raw/master/figures/netflix_data_download.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: some sites have a quick turnaround for exporting your data, some take a while. It is best to try and export what you might want early!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Data Sources\n",
    "These data sources are not automated and require you to manually collect the data at regular intervals or when an event of interest occurs. For example, is there an aspect of your life you'd like to track but don't have an app or software system in place (yet) to automate the process? You can collect data manually via a paper/pencil log, an app, or a spreadsheet. Examples from past projects include:\n",
    "* Log your water/food consumption\n",
    "* Log your study hours\n",
    "* Log your app/laptop/TV screen time\n",
    "* Log your relaxation/stress levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you are thinking of using a manual data source, you might want to start collecting data early to ensure you have a large enough sample!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Analysis\n",
    "For your data source, think about what interesting questions could be mined from its data. Make sure this data has multiple attributes (e.g. is mult-dimensional) and is somewhat complex! For the Fitbit example, here are some ideas:\n",
    "1. Do you get more exercise on the weekend? What about the holidays? What about when you have exams?\n",
    "1. Is the amount of exercise you get correlated with the weather? You could merge this dataset with historical weather data we grab later.\n",
    "1. How do your exercise habits compare to your friends/family? You could create groups of \"study participants\" if we can get this data from other people (with their consent of course!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **PDF document called project_part1.pdf**, provide a list of at least three different data sources that you think could be a great fit for the Quantified Self project. For each data source, provide the following information:\n",
    "1. Is the data source automatic or manual?\n",
    "1. How will the data be collected? If this is an automatic data source, provide a screenshot of example data you are able to download.\n",
    "1. At what interval is the data collected? (e.g. minute-by-minute, daily, at each meal, etc.)\n",
    "1. What are different attributes/dimensions of the data? For the Fitbit example, this would be steps, heart rate, calories burned, sleep levels, etc.)\n",
    "1. Why are you interested in this data source and what would you hope to learn from your analysis of your own data collected from it?\n",
