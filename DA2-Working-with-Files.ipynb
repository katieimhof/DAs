    "## Programming (45 pts)\n",
    "Write a program to open a CSV file, load its data, and summarize its data. The program opens fitbit_data.csv and computes the same statistics you computed from DA1. Like DA1, each statistic should have an informative string label displayed in front of it and should be rounded to 2 decimals places. Check your answers against a desk check (compute the stats by hand) and/or using Excel. The only module you may use for this assignment is the `math` module... that means no `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download the Data\n",
    "Download the fitbit_data.csv file from the DAs repo on Github: https://github.com/GonzagaCPSC222/DAs/blob/master/files/fitbit_data_3-8_9-16.csv. One way to download the data is to click \"Raw\" then right click on the page and click \"Save As.\" Move this data file to be in the same folder as your local DA2 Git repo. This is my own data that I downloaded from the Fitbit website. It has my daily exercise data from 3/8/21 (the day I started training for a half-marathon) to 9/16/21 (the day I posted this assignment ðŸ˜€). I encourage you to open this file up in Excel and become familiar with its header row (column labels) and data. For example, by inspecting the data in Excel, can you tell:\n",
    "1. When spring semester ended?\n",
    "1. When fall semester started?\n",
    "1. When I ran the half-marathon? (BTW, that was my first half-marathon!)\n",
    "1. When I ran the full marathon? (BTW, that was my half-marathon!)\n",
    "1. When I completed the triathlon? (BTW, that was my triathlon, it was a \"sprint\" distance!)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested, I *roughly* followed this [\"Novice 1 Half-Marathon Training Plan\"](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/) and this [\"Novice 1 Marathon Training Plan\"](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup your Code\n",
    "This program should be modular, meaning it decomposed into well-designed functions. With your DA2 Git repo open in VS Code, create two Python files: utils.py and main.py. utils.py will contain our \"utility functions\" that are resuable. main.py will contain our code that calls the utility functions. I'll clearly label which functions are utility functions below :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Functions\n",
    "In utils.py, define your stats functions and data functions. There should be at least a function for the mean, standard deviation, and median/smallest/largest (these can be combined into one function if you'd like). In addition to these stats functions, additional required functions include the following data functions:\n",
    "1. `def read_data(filename)`\n",
    "    1. Opens `filename` for reading and loads the column names into a 1D list called `headers` and loads the data into a 2D list called `data`\n",
    "    1. Returns `headers` and `data`\n",
    "1. `def display_table(headers, data)`\n",
    "    1. Displays the header row and the data in a grid-like table format\n",
    "    1. Do the best you can to try and line up your data for easy reading. Using tabs (\\t) can be quite helpful!\n",
    "1. `def get_column(headers, col_name, data)`\n",
    "    1. Returns a 1D list representing the column named `col_name` in `data`\n",
    "    1. For example, `get_column(headers, \"Steps\", data)` would return the 1D list with only the daily steps data (be sure to maintain the original order)\n",
    "\n",
    "main.py will exercise the above functions. In main.py, `import utils` to gain access to the following functions (call your functions with `utils.read_data(\"fitbit_data.csv\")`, etc.). Define a `main()` function that prompts the user for a column name to compute stats for. Show the stats for the user-entered column. Feel free to define additional functions as you see fit! Remember, one function = one task = one algorithm. Each task should be solved by one algorithm and implemented in its own function. Functions are reusable pieces of code and defining functions now can save you time later :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus (5 pts)\n",
    "Define and call a function, `def slice_column(date_col, col, start_date, end_date)`, that returns a sub-list of `col` from `start_date` (inclusive) to `end_date` exclusive. `date_col` is a list of dates and is the same length as `col`. Use this function to answer these research questions: \n",
    "1. Did my exercise patterns change once I finished the marathon?\n",
    "1. Did my exercise patterns change once the fall semester started? \n",
    "\n",
    "Include your answers to these questions in a comment near the `slice_column()` function."

    "## Project Part 2 (15 pts)\n",
    "For one of your three data sources from DA1 Project Part 1, download a CSV file of your data and include it in your Git repo. Open the file in Excel and trim/fix the data (using Excel) to the point where it can be opened up from Python using your `read_data()` function. Use the fitbit_data.csv as a template to help you structure/clean your data so it is in a similar form. In a file called project_part2.py, `import utils` to gain access to functions you wrote for the programming portion of this assignment. Document any issues or questions you have working with your data in comment blocks in project_part2.py. Hopefully you can get your data open and start playing with it in Python!!"
